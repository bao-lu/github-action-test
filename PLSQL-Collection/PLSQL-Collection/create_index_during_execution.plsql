--
--  This file and the perl script create_index_during_execution.pl is
--  used to demonstrated that an index can be built while a PL/SQL
--  package accesses a table on which the index should be used.
--
--  First, the table tq84_1000000 is createed and filled with 1000000
--  records. Then the package tq84_1000000 iterates 51 times and
--  selects a specific record from the table. After 4 or so selects
--  it writes into a pipe that the index should now be built. This
--  is the perl script's part: it waits for the message on the pipe
--  and as soon as the message arrives, it creates the index.
--
--  While the plsql package iterates and selects from the table,
--  it prints (dbms_output) how long it took to select for each
--  statement. These times should go down dramatically as soon
--  as the index is built.
--
--  Start the perl script first, then run this file in SQL*Plus.
--
